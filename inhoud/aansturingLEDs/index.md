# Middle array: LED-array Mùî≤ŒÆee–≤

This LED-array is powered by x2 1400mA current source and x1 1050mA source:

The red LEDs are powered by one 1400mA current source. It powers the red LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.
The white LEDs are powered by one 1400mA current source. It powers the white LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.
The blue LEDs are powered by one 1050mA current source. It powers the blue LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.

 red: 72 => current = 350mA (30-1000mA), Vf typ= 2.09V 
    => 1400mA source: 18 serie, x4 (parallel) = 72leds/source * 1 source = 72 leds

white: 24 => current = 700mmA (10-1800mA), Vf typ= 2.8V
    => 1400mA source = 12 serie, x2 (parallel) = 24leds/source * 1 source = 24 leds

blue: 24 => current = 175mA (10-250mA), Vf typ= 3V
    => 1050mA source: 4 serie, x6 (parallel) = 24leds/source * 1 source = 24 leds
