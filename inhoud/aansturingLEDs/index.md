# Middle array: LED-array Mùî≤ŒÆee–≤
This LED-array consists of two identical PCB's that are powered in parallel. (look in LED en PCB for schematics of the PCB's).

This LED-array is powered by [x2 1400mA current source](https://www.mouser.be/ProductDetail/MEAN-WELL/LPC-60-1400?qs=O2yOKspD61Aj4Vv%2BmwlI7Q%3D%3D) and [x1 1050mA current source](https://www.mouser.be/ProductDetail/MEAN-WELL/LPC-60-1050?qs=O2yOKspD61CwHxEZesuS%2Fw%3D%3D):

The red LEDs are powered by one 1400mA current source. It powers the red LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.
The white LEDs are powered by one 1400mA current source. It powers the white LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.
The blue LEDs are powered by one 1050mA current source. It powers the blue LEDs on the two PCB's in parallel.
